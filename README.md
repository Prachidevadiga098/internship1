This internship-related data cleaning task focused on transforming a raw, unstructured dataset into a clean and analyzable format. The objective was to apply core data wrangling techniques such as detecting and filling missing data, standardizing inconsistent entries, removing duplicates, and validating data types. The cleaned dataset ensures reliability for downstream tasks like visualization or machine learning, and highlights my attention to detail and technical skill in handling real-world data.
